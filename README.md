# Persian-word-frequency
count the frequency of word in Persian language.
I used 1M of hmblog dataset words to calculate the frequency of each word.
# Steps:
1. getting the root of each word
2. repeated roots was merged by adding the frequency of them
3. calculate the logarithm of each root and save as a pickle.
